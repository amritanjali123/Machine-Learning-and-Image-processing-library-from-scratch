# Machine-Learning-and-Image-processing-library-from-scratch
In this repo I will upload some of the machine learning and image processing code writen from scratch, because implementing any
library can teach us what is happening inside those famous library which we just import and run and also while implementing I learn actual use
of those algorithm which we learn in Data Structure and Algorithm Course like Dfs,Bfs,Convex Hull, swap line algo, etc 
Where my problem-solving ability that I have developed by doing CP really helps me.
